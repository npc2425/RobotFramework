This project is a simple test automation script written using Robot Framework, specifically designed to automate a search on the Python.org website. The script uses SeleniumLibrary to interact with web elements and String library for string manipulations.

Key Components:
Libraries:

SeleniumLibrary: Handles web browser interactions.
String: Provides functions for string manipulation.
Variables:

${BROWSER}: Specifies the browser to be used (Chrome in this case).
${URL}: The URL of the website (https://www.python.org).
${SEARCH_TERM}: The search term to look for (pycon).
Test Case:

Search Python.org: This test case outlines the sequence of actions to perform a search on Python.org.
Setup: Opens the browser, navigates to the Python website, and maximizes the browser window.
Steps:
Inputs the search term (pycon) into the search box.
Submits the search query.
Verifies that the search results contain the term pycon.
Teardown: Closes the browser after the test completes.
Keywords:

Open Browser To Python.org: Opens the browser, navigates to the site, and verifies the page title.
Input Search Term: Inputs the search term in the search bar.
Submit Search: Clicks the submit button.
Verify Search Results: Waits for the search results, retrieves the content, converts it to lowercase, and checks if it contains the search term.
Workflow:
The script opens the browser, navigates to the Python.org website, enters the search term "pycon," and verifies if the search results contain relevant information. After the test, the browser is closed.
This script demonstrates a basic use case of Robot Framework for web automation with Selenium.
